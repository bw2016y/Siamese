   * It is possible for the [[Offset]] type to be a [[SerializedOffset]] when it was

   * JSON representation to determine if the two objects are equal. This could have
   * ramifications when upgrading [[Offset]] JSON formats i.e., two equivalent [[Offset]]
   * objects could differ between version. Consequently, [[StreamExecution]] may call
   * this method with two such equivalent [[Offset]] objects. In which case, the [[Source]]
   * should return an empty [[DataFrame]]
